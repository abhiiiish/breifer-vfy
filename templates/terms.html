                Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its

                limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
                anything through the Service.

                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
                liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
                limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
                for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to

                the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

                Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental
                or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
                each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>

            <h1>
                "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer
            </h1>

            <p> The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
                warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
                behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
                expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
                the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
                performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
                warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
                requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
                systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be
                error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

                Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
                the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the
                Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
                information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content,
                or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,
                malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
                applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
                not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be
                applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law
            </p>
